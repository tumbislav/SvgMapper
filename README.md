#SvgMapper

> SVG from Aitoff to Winkel, with style


## What is SvgMapper?
SvgMapper is a Python tool that will, in a nutshell, take a map in SVG format, apply any one of a dozen cartographic 
projections and create an output SVG. Additionally, you can tell it to add stuff to your map, change its style, 
draw graticules, add symbols and so on. You can also use it for things like creating blank graticule files as
a starting point for new maps.
